				<p>In many countries, humans are employed to manually segregate waste at landfills - a detrimental and debilitating labor that desperately seeks reform and automation to avoid putting thousands at risk. <br />
				A possible solution to this complex issue was invented to efficiently integrate an embedded system that physical sorts of wasted to an Artificial Intelligent system that assigns a segregation label to the waste objects.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Constructed a novel mechanical system equipped with a coveyor belt, robotic arms, sensors to detect the waste entering the system and a camera system to capture images of the waste to be classified</li>
					<li>Based on the labels of the captured images of the waste objects generated by the designed neural networks, the waste objects were automatically segregated into the respective bins with the help of the robotic arms with no human intervention required in the entire process</li>
					<li>The project was recognized by a division at the Indian Institute of Science who provided a grant for the execution of the project. A patent has been published for the novelty of the idea and awaits a grant</li>
