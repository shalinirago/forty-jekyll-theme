					<li>While courses exist that teach software implementations, a holistic teaching method that explains the design methodologies to be undertaken before diving into writing code is a rare find</li>
					<li>The goal of the course was to emphasise on problem solving tasks before rushing to execution methods while teaching basic OOPs concepts and critical thinking in a fun and exciting manner</li>
					<li>Designed C++ client-server socket programming APIs for students to use for their course projects to control simulated drones on Microsoft AirSim and deployed the APIs to control DJI Tello Drones</li>
